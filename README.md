Nest Panel for Panic's Status Board for iOS
===========================================

Generates a panel for Panic's Status Board for iOS that displays current stats for a Nest thermostat.

Release Notes
=============
This is very much a first-run release. I plan to nix the meta refresh in favor of AJAX. This will stop the fan icon from disappearing momentarily on refresh if the fan on the Nest is actually running.
