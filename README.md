Nest Panel for Panic's Status Board for iOS
---

Generates a panel for <a href="http://panic.com/statusboard/">Panic's Status Board</a> for iOS that displays current stats for a Nest thermostat using PHP.

Requirements
---
* <a href="http://www.nest.com">Nest Learning Thermostat</a>
* <a href="http://panic.com/statusboard/">Panic Status Board</a>
* Internet-connected web server capable of running PHP

Release Notes
---
This is very much a first-run release. I plan to nix the meta refresh in favor of AJAX. This will stop the fan icon from disappearing momentarily on refresh if the fan on the Nest is actually running.
